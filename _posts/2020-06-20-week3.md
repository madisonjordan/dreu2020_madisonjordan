### Challenges:
This week I was worried about the website requirements and what would be expected of me in completing them. Mainly, I just wanted to know if it was okay if I added posts that weren't these journal entries, and if I could post resources I used compiled in a separate post, in case the 5 people out there who read this were curious.
To that end, I knew I had to ask the DREU coordinators, but speaking to people who are unfamiliar takes a few days for me to build up the courage to talk to. I often feel I am inconveniencing people. 
Despite that, I really wanted to create something amazing for the website and found it in myself to ask in an email. Amanda Stent, one of the organizers, promptly answered all my questions and it turned out to be less of a big deal than I was making it out to be in my mind; that made me feel a lot better about this and more excited to complete my tasks. She did say I could customize the theme of the website and give me more guidance on what these journal entries might entail.
