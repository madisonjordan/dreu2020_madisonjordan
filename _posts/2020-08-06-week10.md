## Task List:
- plan out paper and citations
- redesign website
- upload remaining journal entries

### Challenges:
Making this website. I spent so long making this website. I finally got the categories and navigation working after several hours of reading through different docs, posts, and templates. I still have not figured out how to get some of the posts to navigate in a way that makes sense for the format for these journal entries. I just realized after all these posts, it would be way better if I had a "previous" and "next" button.
Update: I had the wrong layout set for my journal posts. It is fixed.
