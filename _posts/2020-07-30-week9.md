## Task List:
- finish chapter 10 in Deep Learning Book
- read text analysis paper

### Challenges:
Chapter 10 was probably the hardest for me to read. The sequential RNN made sense to me conceptually, but the equations and the diagrams confused me when I tried to understand how they are implemented in greater detail.
I had to re-read some parts a few times; LSTM is the other key part to the experiments I would be conducting on the sarcasm dataset. It should help me to understand how the meaning of the sentence is affected by the context of the words surrounding each word.

### Resources used this week:
- Deep Learning text
- text analysis paper from Professor Verma's page

## Next Steps:
- finish final milestone requirements
- customize website
- schedule meeting after report to review Chapter 10
- prepare for experiment after finishing final milestone
