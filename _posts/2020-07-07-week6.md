## Task List:
- complete chapters 5-6 in deep learning book
- send link to google doc with questions and send email 
- send copy of progress report

### Challenges:
The Deep Learning textbook is pretty content heavy. I haven't taken any machine learning or AI class yet. It's mostly equations and none of the information is frivolous despite the chapters being pretty long. 
I felt pretty overwhelmed at the pressure of believing I had to read all of it by myself with little background knowledge other than the crash course Dr Bein provided for me and the practical knowledge from the Python for Data Science course.
After discussing with Dr Verma and Dr Bein, they told me that they are here to help me and that the reading is to prime my knowledge and gain some understanding, then ask them questions for clarification, then finally experiment and achieve understanding.


### Resources used this week:
- Deep Learning textbook
