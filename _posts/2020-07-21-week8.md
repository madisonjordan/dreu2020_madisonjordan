## Task List:
- read chapter 9 in deep learning book
- study cifar10 and CNN interactive examples

### Challenges:
I had a hard time getting the streamlit library to work when trying to follow the assigned tutorial on using CNN on the cifar10 dataset.
Dr Verma told me that chapter 9 on Convolutional Neural Networks is essential for me to continue my research on the sarcasm dataset we had decided to use in our experiment.


### Resources used this week:
- website interactive examples for CNN
- Deep Learning text


## Next Steps:
- finish up last chapter in deep learning textbook
- discuss final report writing with mentors
