## Task List:
- read chapter 7-8
- look up tensorflow playground for LSTM
- study CNN and LSTM

### Challenges:
I mainly focused on using the tensorflow playground this week. I understood most of the concepts on the page from my reading, but understanding the numerical values of them in a real example was difficult for me to understand. I had a lot of questions this week to ask of my mentors about how the concepts I had learned in the Deep Learning textbook connected to real data in the way I was seeing in the page. 

### Resources used this week:
- tensorflow playground website
- deep learning text


## Next Steps:
- focus on learning CNN and LSTM in Chapters 9 and 10
