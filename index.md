## About My Project

The project uses data science analysis to determine how to improve accuracy of accident predictions for car safety. It uses a LIDAR sensor and a device to monitor brain waves of a test subject to determine whether an accident in imminent. We hope to implement the use of Amazon Deep Lens for additional data about possible collisons.
