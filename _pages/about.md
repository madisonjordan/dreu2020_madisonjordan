## About Me

My name is Madison Jordan. I am a junior studying computer science at Cal State University, Fullerton. I expect to graduate with a BS in Computer Science during Fall 2021.

## About My Mentors

My mentor this summer is Dr Doina Bein, an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at Cal State University, Fullerton.
She received her PhD at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with expertise in: 
Automatic Dynamic Decision-making Distributed computing, fault tolerant algorithms, graph embedding, randomized algorithms, sensor fusion, ad hoc and wireless networks

I am lucky enough to have a second mentor join us this summer; Dr Abhishek Verma is currently an Associate Professor of Computer Science at New Jersey City University, NJ. His current research applies data science, bigdata, and machine learning to policing, robotics, surveillance, defense, medical imaging, healthcare analytics, financial market analysis, marine science, and biometric security.
